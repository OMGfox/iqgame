# IQGame
The python3.6 and higher needed<br>
<br>
My realisation of the educational game. The main goal of game is set up all figures in the game field. The game will have levels with preset figures. The low number of the preset figures the harder seek the needed variant.

### The main games field view
![iqgame interface](/screenshots/screen001.png "iqgame interface")

### Installation and starting
just install all the requarements from requarements.txt<br>
***pip install -r requirements.txt***<br>
and start the game with the command:<br>
***python iqgame.py***<br>
<br>
Have fun and enjoy!
